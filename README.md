# Markdown Previewer

## Overview

A webpage built with React that dynamically parses markdown into HTML.

## Description

This page utilizes various frontend libraries and frameworks including Bootstrap, SASS, and React. This was an excellent opportunity for me to see how to use SASS with React. It was also a unique opportunity to understand how the marked library works, which is what parses the markdown into HTML.

In React, I usually built functional components, but I wanted to challenge myself and build this container component as a class component with a constructor and binding my methods to this. I'm glad that I did, because I feel like it helped me gain a better understanding of React. 

Overall, I am excited about what I learned in building this page and look forward to applying these concepts in future projects.
